# 46 Python Functions That I Made For Practice.

This file contains 46 functions that I made to practice during holiday. Some functions regard
Math, other strings, and much much more.

# Use.

If you want to have some practice when you have some free time, I suggest trying to solve those
problems. I don't know about you, but it really helped me.

# Found any bugs?

Please don't be shy to inform me about possible bugs. Since I am relatively new  to Python, there
may be multiple bugs. I am open to criticism.
